## Known Issues

- Your device needs to be connected for the application to work.

## Disclaimers

- This application is not official. Any damage (to the unit or any peripherals), misuse or act that avoids warranty is not our responsibility. Use it at your own risk.
- Differently from the official bluetooth mobile app, this application can't reflect commands from the device. Meaning: if you change a fader in the mobile app, you won't see it reflected in this application.
- Only basic MIDI commands are implemented (for now - this is a work in progress).
- We do accept requests.
- Current and future implementations are limited by the [FLOW 8 MIDI Implementation](https://mediadl.musictribe.com/media/PLM/data/docs/P0DNM/QSG_BE_0603-AEW_FLOW-8_WW.pdf#page=23).
- Later, I found [another solution](https://ikarusstore.com/community/articulo-27-control-your-behringer-flow-8-via-windows-mac-controla-tu-behringer-flow-8-via-windows-y-mac) for controlling this unit. Give it a try and use what is best for you!
